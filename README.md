## Pixeldrain Viewer & Download - With Bypass

### Description
This userscript enhances the PixelDrain experience by adding the following functionalities:

- **File List Click Handling**: When a user clicks on a file in a list, the script intercepts the click, extracts the file ID, and opens the file link in a new tab.
- **Multimedia Content Display with Bypass**: For individual file links, the script displays multimedia content directly on the page using a video player or image viewer with bypass, which does not consume your download bandwidth.
- **Download Buttons with Bypass**: Adds download bypass buttons for individual files and file lists, allowing users to download files directly or a zipped list of files without consuming their download bandwidth and without navigating through the standard site interface.

### Usage Example
- When accessing a file list at `https://pixeldrain.com/l/*`, clicking any file will open the file page in a new tab.
- When accessing an individual file at `https://pixeldrain.com/u/*`, the file's content will be displayed directly on the page.
- The "Download Bypass" and "Download ZIP Bypass" buttons will allow you to download files and file lists directly, without consuming your download bandwidth and without navigating through the standard interface.
